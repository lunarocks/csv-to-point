# csv-to-point
Simple csv to point using ArcPy

This is an ArcGIS/ArcPy Script Tool that asks the user for a spatial reference, a csv file path, a gdb workspace, and an oupute point class name. 
This tool was built for use with the schools.csv file in the repository. 
The pdf file is the resulting map, edited with Adobe ArcGIS plugin.
